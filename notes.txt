To do list:
- Work on the format of the logs
- Include relevant stats like bot profits, wins, losses, average win, average
loss, etc.
- Program a decent strategy and run a bunch of tests. Clean up, optimize,
organize, bug fixing, etc.
- Release first working version

Essentially, the fake portfolios p_fake and p_trade only store information about
how much asset and base are owned. The restriction is that the size of the fake
portfolios totals 1 when they are initialized or reset.
- p_fake tracks profits from the start disregarding all withdrawals and deposits
- p_trade tracks profits disregarding all withdrawals and deposits, but is reset
whenever the bot enters no-position status.

update_f should only be called when fake portfolios are initialized or when
a trade has been detected.
- Added a check to cancel the update_f function if apc (avg price current) == 0

So anyways.. I think what I'll do is store p_fake and p_trade as positions data
structures like self.positions_f and self.positions_t
- On tick 1 these are set up so that they have the same rin/rinT as the user
portfolio and they have a total size of 1
- There is no meaningful fake portfolio between init and tick 1.
