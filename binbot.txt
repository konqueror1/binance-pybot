- Takes an API key and a pair
- When run, will import interval_mins candle data in such a way where the next
    candle will come in 1-2 minutes
- On the first new candle, init() will be ran
- On the following new candles, tick() will be ran

On each tick, I need:
(ins)
- Market (exchange/pair)
- Interval
- OHLCV data (candle data)
(portfolios)
- Positions (all owned coins or at least the coins the bot is using.)

On each tick I would like to take care of things like importing the portfolio,
checking for deposits, withdrawals, and trades, and calculating profits. I also
want a built in buy and sell function and pretty much anything else to do with
communicating with binance.

Currently init is ran right at the start, then tick is run 1-2 minutes later and
every interval mins after that.

positions structure:
positions = {
    "asset1": "amt",
    "asset2": "amt",
    ...
}

I don't have the total account size. I also don't have the prices for each asset.
I do have the price of the pair though, from ins. So I can calculate the size
of the trading account in terms of the base coin.

If I wanted to monitor all coins it would be hard to determine dw or other trade
status.. If I only monitor the trading account it will be about the same as on
ct.

However, I could use my ability to get info about dws and other trades... And I
could use that to monitor all of the coins.

Anyways, for now I'll just monitor the trading account like on CT. This will be
easier.
