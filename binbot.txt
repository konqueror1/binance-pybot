- Takes an API key and a pair
- When run, will import interval_mins candle data in such a way where the next
    candle will come in 1-2 minutes
- On the first new candle, init() will be ran
- On the following new candles, tick() will be ran

On each tick, I need:
(ins)
- Market (exchange/pair)
- Interval
- OHLCV data (candle data)
(portfolios)
- Positions (all owned coins or at least the coins the bot is using.)

On each tick I would like to take care of things like importing the portfolio,
checking for deposits, withdrawals, and trades, and calculating profits. I also
want a built in buy and sell function and pretty much anything else to do with
communicating with binance.

Currently init is ran right at the start, then tick is run 1-2 minutes later and
every interval mins after that.
